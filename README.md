Scripts and extension attributes I use in Jamf Pro

February 2022: I am archiving this repository for the time being. In my current line of work I'm not maintaining or publishing Jamf Pro related work.

November 2024: I am now back in a Jamf Pro role, and unarchiving this repository! Keep in mind right now a lot of content in here is old and likely irrelevant. Hopefully that will change soon.
